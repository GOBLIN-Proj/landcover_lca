   .. py:method:: co2_emissions_wetland_drained()

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the drainage of wetlands.
      Wetland drainage can lead to significant CO2 emissions, primarily due to the exposure
      and decomposition of organic matter that was previously submerged and preserved
      under waterlogged conditions.

      This method calculates CO2 emissions by considering two main emission factors:
      emissions from the drainage site itself and emissions due to dissolved organic carbon
      (DOC). DOC refers to organic carbon released into water bodies as a result of wetland
      drainage.

      Emission factors are sourced from a country-specific database (`ef_country`) of
      emission factors, considering the unique characteristics of wetlands in different
      regions.

      :returns:

                The calculated CO2 emissions (in a suitable unit like kg or tonnes) from
                    wetland drainage. The calculation is based on the current area of drained
                    wetland and the sum of the two emission factors, one for on-site emissions
                    and the other for emissions due to DOC.

      drainage.


   .. py:method:: drainage_ch4_organic_soils()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic soils,
      such as peatlands. Drainage of such soils can significantly increase methane
      emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, due to the exposure of previously waterlogged
      organic matter to aerobic conditions, leading to its decomposition.

      The method considers different emission factors for peatland that is drained
      for land use (e.g., agriculture) and for drainage via ditches.

      Emission factors are retrieved from a database of emission factors specific
      to the country (`ef_country`) provided at the class initialization.

      soils. N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, is often released in significant amounts when
      wetlands, especially peatlands, are drained. The drainage process alters the soil
      conditions, promoting conditions favorable for N2O production.

      This method calculates N2O emissions specifically for the drainage of wetland.

      The emission factor is obtained from a country-specific database of emission
      factors, ensuring the calculation is tailored to the regional characteristics
      of the land use change.

      land management practices or wildfires.

      The calculation incorporates two key emission factors: one for the burning of
      wetland fuels (biomass) and another that represents the emission factors
      (Gef) for CO2 emissions from wetland burning. These factors are sourced from
      a country-specific database, reflecting regional variations in wetland
      composition and burning practices.

      The total CO2 emissions are estimated by multiplying the total combined area
      of the wetland, the proportion of the wetland that is burnt, and the product
      of the two emission factors.

      :returns:

                The calculated CO2 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of wetlands.
                    The calculation is based on the combined wetland area, the share of

      greenhouse gas, released during the combustion of wetland biomass, which can
      occur due to natural fires, agricultural burning, or other human activities.

      The calculation involves two primary emission factors: one for the combustion
      of wetland fuels (biomass) and another representing the emission factor
      (Gef) for CH4 emissions specifically from wetland burning. These emission factors
      are sourced from a country-specific database to account for regional differences
      in wetland burning characteristics and fuel types.

      The total CH4 emissions are estimated by multiplying the combined wetland area,
      the proportion of wetland that is burnt, and the product of the two emission
      factors.

      :returns:

   .. py:method:: burning_n2o_wetland()

      Calculates the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the burning of wetland
      vegetation and organic matter. Wetland burning can be a significant source of N2O,
      a potent greenhouse gas, especially when it involves the combustion of peat and
      other nitrogen-rich organic materials.

      This method incorporates two emission factors: one for the combustion of wetland
      fuels (biomass) and another for the emission factor (Gef) specific to N2O
      emissions from wetland burning. These emission factors are obtained from a
      country-specific database, which accounts for variations in wetland types and
      burning practices across different regions.

      The total N2O emissions are estimated by multiplying the combined area of the
      wetland, the proportion of the wetland that is burnt, and the product of the two

   .. py:method:: drainage_co2_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic
      soils in grassland areas. Draining organic soils can lead to significant CO2 emissions.
      This process exposes previously waterlogged organic matter to oxygen, accelerating its
      decomposition and releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere.

      This method focuses specifically on CO2 emissions from on-site sources in grasslands
      where organic soils have been drained. The emission factor used for this calculation
      is tailored to the specific conditions of drained grasslands, reflecting the typical
      rate of CO2 emissions per unit area for such land use change.

      The emission factor is obtained from a country-specific database of emission factors,
      ensuring the calculation is representative of regional characteristics and land
      management practices.

      in grassland areas. The drainage of organic soils can significantly
      increase CH4 emissions due to the exposure of previously waterlogged organic matter
      to conditions that promote methane production.

      This method estimates CH4 emissions for two types of drainage in grasslands: direct
      land drainage and drainage through ditches. Each type of drainage has its own emission
      factor, reflecting the different conditions and methane production rates associated
      with these drainage methods.

      Emission factors are sourced from a country-specific database, ensuring that the
      emissions estimation is relevant to the regional characteristics of grassland drainage.

      :returns: The calculated CH4 emissions from organic soils in grassland areas.

   .. py:method:: drainage_n2O_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic
      soils in grassland areas. Drainage of organic soils in grasslands can lead to increased N2O emissions.
      This is due to the changes in soil conditions that promote nitrification and denitrification processes,
      which are major sources of N2O emissions.

      This method estimates N2O emissions by applying an emission factor specific to
      grassland drainage.

      The emission factor is obtained from a country-specific database of emission factors,
      ensuring the calculation takes into account regional variations in soil types,
      grassland management practices, and climatic conditions.

      :returns: The calculated N2O emissionsresulting from the drainage of organic soils in grassland areas.

   .. py:method:: rewetting_co2_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions resulting from the rewetting
      of drained organic soils in grassland areas. Rewetting previously drained organic
      soils can significantly reduce CO2 emissions by restoring waterlogged conditions,
      which slow down the decomposition of organic matter and carbon release.

      This method considers two key emission reduction factors: the reduction of direct
      on-site CO2 emissions due to rewetting and the reduction of CO2 emissions related
      to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The latter factor accounts for the decrease in
      carbon released into water bodies as a result of rewetting.

      The emission reduction factors are sourced from a country-specific database, ensuring
      that the calculation is tailored to the regional characteristics of grassland
      management and soil types.

      :returns: The calculated CO2 emissions reductions resulting from the rewetting of
                organic soils in grassland areas. The reductions are based on the total area
                undergoing transition from drained to rewetted conditions and the sum of the two emission reduction
                factors for on-site emissions and DOC-related emissions.

      transition from drained to rewetted conditions, used in the calculation for
      estimating total CO2 emissions reductions.


   .. py:method:: rewetting_ch4_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the rewetting of drained
      organic soils in grassland areas. Rewetting such soils, particularly in areas
      previously used as peatlands or other wetlands, can lead to an increase in CH4
