   .. py:method:: drainage_co2_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) onsite and offsite emissions resulting from the drainage of organic
      soils in grassland areas. Draining organic soils can lead to significant CO2 emissions.
      This process exposes previously waterlogged organic matter to oxygen, accelerating its
      decomposition and releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere.

      This method focuses specifically on CO2 emissions from on-site sources in grasslands
      where organic soils have been drained. The emission factor used for this calculation
      is tailored to the specific conditions of drained grasslands, reflecting the typical
      rate of CO2 emissions per unit area for such land use change.

      The emission factors are obtained from a country-specific database of emission factors,
      ensuring the calculation is representative of regional characteristics and land
      management practices.

      :returns:

                The calculated CO2 emissions in kg resulting from the drainage of organic soils
                    in grassland areas. The emissions are based on the current area of drained

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the drainage of poor and rich organic soils
      in grassland areas. The drainage of organic soils can significantly
      increase CH4 emissions due to the exposure of previously waterlogged organic matter

      soils in grassland areas. Drainage of organic soils in grasslands can lead to increased N2O emissions.

   .. py:method:: rewetting_ch4_organic_soils_in_grassland()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the rewetting of drained
      organic soils in grassland areas. Rewetting such soils, particularly in areas
      previously used as peatlands or other wetlands, can lead to an increase in CH4
      emissions. This is due to the creation of anaerobic conditions favorable for
      methanogenesis (methane production) in waterlogged soils.

      This method utilizes an emission factor that specifically quantifies the rate
      of CH4 emissions per unit area resulting from the rewetting of organic soils in
      grassland environments. The emission factor is sourced from a country-specific
      database, accounting for variations in soil types, previous land use practices,
      and climatic conditions.

      The total CH4 emissions are estimated based on the total area of grasslands
      undergoing transition from drained to rewetted conditions and the emission
      factor for grassland rewetting.

      :returns: The calculated CH4 emissions resulting from the rewetting of organic
                soils in grassland areas.
                The emissions are based on the total transition area and the specific

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the burning of grasslands.
      This method assesses CO2 emissions from two types of soil in grasslands: mineral soils
      and drained organic soils. The emission calculation is based on the formula
      𝐿𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑒 = 𝐴 ∙ 𝑀𝐵 ∙ 𝐶𝑓 ∙ 𝐺𝑒𝑓 ∙ 10^−3, where A is the area, MB is the biomass,
      Cf is the combustion factor, and Gef is the emission factor.

      The combustion factor (Cf) is assumed to be 1.0, indicating that all available fuel
      (biomass) is burned. The method involves multiplying the area of grassland burned by
      the emission factors for CO2 emissions from both mineral and drained organic soils.
