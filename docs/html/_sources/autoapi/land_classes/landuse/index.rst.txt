.. py:class:: LandUse(ef_country, transition_matrix_data, land_use_data, past_land_use_data, past_land_use=None, current_land_use=None)


   The LandUse class is designed to analyze and calculate various aspects of
   land use and land use change, focusing on their environmental impact in
   terms of emissions and land area transitions.

   This class processes data related to different land use categories,
   considering both historical (past) and future (projected) land use scenarios,
   to understand the dynamics of land use changes and their environmental
   consequences.

   :param ef_country: The country for which the land use data is being
                      analyzed. Essential for loading country-specific data
                      and emission factors.
   :type ef_country: str
   :param transition_matrix_data: An instance of
                                  TransitionMatrixData class
                                  containing data for
                                  transitions between
                                  different land use
                                  categories over time.
   :type transition_matrix_data: TransitionMatrixData
   :param land_use_data: Land use transition data for future scenarios.
   :param past_land_use_data: Data representing current or past land use scenarios.
   :param past_land_use: The past land use category. Defaults to None.
   :type past_land_use: str, optional
   :param current_land_use: The current/future land use category. Defaults
                            to None.
   :type current_land_use: str, optional

   .. py:method:: get_time_period()

      Calculates the time period between the current (or future) and past land
      use scenarios. This period helps in understanding the duration over which
      land use changes have occurred or are projected to occur.

      :returns:

                The time period in years between the current (or future) and past
                     land use data.
      :rtype: int


   .. py:method:: compute_land_use_annual_area()

      Calculates the annual area that has been or is projected to be converted
      from the past land use to the current (or future) land use category.
      This calculation is crucial for understanding the rate of land use change
      on an annual basis.

      :returns:

                The annual area converted (in hectares) from past
                       to current (or future) land use, averaged over the time period.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: get_total_transition_area()

      Retrieves the total area that has transitioned or is projected to transition
      from the past land use category to the current (or future) land use category.
      This measure is vital for assessing the scale of land use change.

      :returns:

                The total transition area (in hectares) between
                       the past and current (or future) land use categories.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: compute_total_land_use_area()

      Computes the total area covered by the current (or future) land use category.
      This measurement provides insight into the extent of a specific land use type
      within the selected region or country.

      :returns:

                The total area (in hectares) covered by the
                       current (or future) land use category.
      :rtype: float
