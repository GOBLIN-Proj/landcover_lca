   Bases: :py:obj:`landcover_lca.land_classes.landuse.LandUse`

   Represents a cropland land use.

   :param - ef_country: The country for which the land use data is being analyzed.
   :type - ef_country: str
   :param - transition_matrix_data: An instance of TransitionMatrixData
                                    class containing data for transitions between different land use categories over time.
   :type - transition_matrix_data: TransitionMatrixData
   :param - land_use_data: Land use transition data for future scenarios.
   :param - past_land_use_data: Data representing current or past land use scenarios.
   :param - past_land_use: The past land use category. Defaults to None.
   :type - past_land_use: str, optional
   :param - current_land_use: The current/future land use category. Defaults to None.
   :type - current_land_use: str, optional

   .. attribute:: - current_land_use

      The current/future land use category.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: - current_area

      The current area of cropland.

      :type: float

   .. attribute:: - current_area_drained

      The current area of cropland that is drained.

      :type: float

   .. method:: - burning_ch4_cropland

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the
      burning of cropland.

   .. method:: - burning_n2o_cropland

      Calculates the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from
      the burning of cropland.
      

   .. py:method:: burning_ch4_cropland()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the burning of cropland.
      This method assesses CH4 emissions specifically from cropland areas where
      crop residues and other biomass are burnt, a practice that can significantly
      contribute to CH4 emissions.

      The calculation involves two emission factors: one for the fuel burning in
      croplands (biomass combustion) and another emission factor (Gef) for
      CH4 emissions from cropland burning. These factors are sourced from a
      country-specific database, reflecting regional variations in agricultural
      practices and crop types.

      The total CH4 emissions are estimated by multiplying the current area of
      cropland that is burnt, the emission factors for fuel burning, and the
      general emission factor for CH4. The result is converted into tonnes for
      easier reporting and comparison.

      :returns:

                The calculated CH4 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of
                    cropland. The calculation considers the area of cropland burnt,
                    the specific emission factor for fuel burning in croplands, and
                    the general emission factor for CH4 emissions.
      :rtype: float

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - `ef_cropland_fuel_burning` refers to the emission factor for the burning
      of cropland fuels in terms of CH4.
      - `ef_ch4_cropland_Gef` is the general emission factor for CH4 emissions
      from cropland burning.
      - `self.current_area` represents the current area of cropland being analyzed.
      - `self.land_use_data.cropland.share_burnt` indicates the percentage of the
      cropland area that undergoes burning.


   .. py:method:: burning_n2o_cropland()

      Calculates the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the burning of cropland.
      This method assesses N2O emissions specifically from cropland areas where crop
      residues and other biomass are burnt, a practice that can significantly contribute
      to N2O emissions.

      The calculation involves two emission factors: one for the fuel burning in croplands
      (biomass combustion) and another emission factor (Gef) for N2O emissions
      from cropland burning. These factors are sourced from a country-specific database,
      reflecting regional variations in agricultural practices and crop types.

      The total N2O emissions are estimated by multiplying the current area of cropland
      that is burnt, the emission factors for fuel burning, and the emission factor
      for N2O.

      :returns:

                The calculated N2O emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of cropland.
                    The calculation considers the area of cropland burnt, the specific
                    emission factor for fuel burning in croplands, and the general emission
                    factor for N2O emissions.
