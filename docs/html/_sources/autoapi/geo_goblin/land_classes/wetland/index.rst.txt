      and near-natural wetlands offsite.

      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: ch4_emissions_unmanaged_and_near_natural()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the drainage of unmanaged
      and near-natural wetlands. Drainage of such wetlands can lead to the release of
      methane, a potent greenhouse gas, due to the exposure of previously waterlogged
      organic matter to aerobic conditions, promoting its decomposition.

      :returns: The calculated CH4 emissions in kg from unmanaged and near-natural wetland drainage.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_co2_wetland()

      Calculates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the burning of wetland
      vegetation and organic matter. This method focuses on CO2 emissions due to the
      combustion of wetland biomass, which can occur in various scenarios, such as
      land management practices or wildfires.

      The calculation incorporates two key emission factors: one for the burning of
      wetland fuels (biomass) and another that represents the emission factors
      (Gef) for CO2 emissions from wetland burning. These factors are sourced from
      a country-specific database, reflecting regional variations in wetland
      composition and burning practices.

      The total CO2 emissions are estimated by multiplying the total combined area
      of the wetland, the proportion of the wetland that is burnt, and the product
      of the two emission factors.

      :returns:

                The calculated CO2 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of wetlands.
                    The calculation is based on the combined wetland area, the share of
                    wetlands burnt, and the specific emission factors for wetland fuel
                    burning and general CO2 emissions.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_ch4_wetland()

      Calculates the methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the burning of wetland
      vegetation and organic matter. This method assesses CH4 emissions, a potent
      greenhouse gas, released during the combustion of wetland biomass, which can
      occur due to natural fires, agricultural burning, or other human activities.

      The calculation involves two primary emission factors: one for the combustion
      of wetland fuels (biomass) and another representing the emission factor
      (Gef) for CH4 emissions specifically from wetland burning. These emission factors
      are sourced from a country-specific database to account for regional differences
      in wetland burning characteristics and fuel types.

      The total CH4 emissions are estimated by multiplying the combined wetland area,
      the proportion of wetland that is burnt, and the product of the two emission
      factors.

      :returns:

                The calculated CH4 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of wetlands.
                    This is determined by considering the combined wetland area, the share
                    of wetlands burnt, and the specific emission factors for wetland fuel
                    burning and general CH4 emissions.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_n2o_wetland()

      Calculates the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the burning of wetland
      vegetation and organic matter. Wetland burning can be a significant source of N2O,
      a potent greenhouse gas, especially when it involves the combustion of peat and
      other nitrogen-rich organic materials.

      This method incorporates two emission factors: one for the combustion of wetland
      fuels (biomass) and another for the emission factor (Gef) specific to N2O
      emissions from wetland burning. These emission factors are obtained from a
      country-specific database, which accounts for variations in wetland types and
      burning practices across different regions.

      The total N2O emissions are estimated by multiplying the combined area of the
      wetland, the proportion of the wetland that is burnt, and the product of the two
      emission factors.

      :returns:

                The calculated N2O emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of wetlands.
                    The computation takes into account the combined wetland area, the
                    proportion of wetlands burnt, and the respective emission factors for
                    wetland fuel burning and general N2O emissions.
