   Bases: :py:obj:`landcover_lca.geo_goblin.land_classes.landuse.LandUse`

   The Forest class is specifically tailored to handle calculations and assessments
   related to forest land use. It includes methods to estimate greenhouse gas emissions
   from various activities and conditions in forest ecosystems, such as drainage and burning.

   In addition to inheriting the functionalities of the LandUse class, the Forest
   class introduces specific attributes and methods to deal with forest-related
   data and emissions factors.

   .. py:method:: get_valid_area()

      Calculates the valid areas for poorly drained and richly drained forests,
      excluding forest areas that are over 50 years old. This method is crucial
      for determining the specific areas within forests that are relevant for
      certain environmental impact calculations, such as emissions from drainage
      or rewetting.

      The method first determines the proportion of forest area that is over 50
      years old and then calculates the remaining area (valid area) that is
      younger than 50 years. This valid area is then further divided into poorly
      drained and richly drained forest areas based on specific land use data.

      :returns:

                A tuple containing two values:
                    - The first value is the valid area of poorly drained forests
                    (considering only forests younger than 50 years).
                    - The second value is the valid area of richly drained forests
                    (considering only forests younger than 50 years).
      :rtype: tuple

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - The method uses 'forest_age_data' to determine the proportion of
      forest area over 50 years old.
      - 'land_use_data.forest.share_organic' and
      'land_use_data.forest.share_organic_mineral' are used to differentiate
      between poorly drained and richly drained forest areas.


   .. py:method:: co2_drainage_organic_soils_forest()

      Estimates the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic
      soils in forest areas. This method considers both poorly and richly drained forest
      areas, excluding those over 50 years old, as it is assumed that areas older than
      50 years do not emit CO2 due to drainage.

      The calculation uses specific emission factors for both on-site and off-site drainage
      emissions. For richly drained forests, the emissions are adjusted based on the soil
      depth ratio to provide a more accurate estimation.

      :returns:

                The total CO2 emissions from the drainage of organic soils in forest areas.
                    This includes emissions from both poorly and richly drained forests,
                    excluding those over 50 years old.
      :rtype: float

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - `ef_co2_forest_drainage_off_site` and `ef_co2_forest_drainage_on_site` are
      the emission factors for off-site and on-site CO2 emissions, respectively,
      from forest drainage.
      - `soil_depth` represents the depth of the organic mineral soil, used to
      adjust the emission calculations for richly drained forests.
      - `self.poor_drained_forest_area_exclude_over_50` and
      `self.rich_drained_forest_area_exclude_over_50` represent the valid areas
      of poorly and richly drained forests that are younger than 50 years.


   .. py:method:: ch4_drainage_organic_soils_forest()

      Calculates methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic soils in
      forest areas. This method considers two types of drainage situations in forests:
      drainage on land and drainage through ditches, each with different emission factors.

      The method applies distinct emission factors for poorly and richly drained forests,
      taking into account the fraction of each forest type drained through ditches.
      This provides a more accurate estimation of CH4 emissions by considering the
      specific drainage practices employed in different forest areas.

      :returns:

                The total CH4 emissions in kg from the drainage of organic soils in forest areas.
                    This includes emissions from both poorly and richly drained forests,
                    taking into account the respective proportions of drainage through ditches.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: n2o_drainage_organic_soils_forest()

      Calculates nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the drainage of organic
      soils in forest areas. This method separately considers the emissions from poorly
      and richly drained forests, each with their specific emission factors.

      The calculation involves applying distinct emission factors for N2O emissions for
      both poorly and richly drained forests. This approach ensures a more accurate
      estimation of N2O emissions by considering the specific drainage characteristics
      and soil conditions of different forest types.

      :returns:

                The total N2O emissions in kg from the drainage of organic soils in forest areas.
                    This includes emissions from both poorly and richly drained forests,
                    calculated using the respective emission factors for each forest type.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_co2_forest()

      Calculates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the burning of forests.
      This method assesses CO2 emissions specifically from forest areas where vegetation
      and other biomass are burnt, a practice that can significantly contribute to CO2 emissions.

      The calculation involves multiple factors: an emission factor for the fuel burning in
      forests, a emission factor (Gef) for CO2 emissions from forest burning, and a
      combustion factor (Cf) that represents the efficiency of biomass combustion.

      The total CO2 emissions are estimated by multiplying the area of forest burnt, the
      emission factor for fuel burning, the combustion factor, and the emission factor
      for CO2. The result is then converted into tonnes for easier reporting and comparison.

      :returns:

                The calculated CO2 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of forest areas.
                    The calculation considers the area of forest burnt, the specific emission
                    factor for fuel burning in forests, the combustion factor, and the
                    emission factor for CO2 emissions.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_ch4_forest()

      Calculates methane (CH4) emissions resulting from the burning of forests. This method
      assesses CH4 emissions specifically from forest areas where vegetation and other
      biomass are burnt, which can be a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

      The calculation involves several factors: an emission factor for the fuel burning in
      forests, a emission factor (Gef) for CH4 emissions from forest burning, and a
      combustion factor (Cf) that represents the efficiency of biomass combustion.

      The total CH4 emissions are estimated by multiplying the area of forest burnt, the
      emission factor for fuel burning, the combustion factor, and the emission factor
      for CH4. The result is then converted into tonnes for easier reporting and comparison.

      :returns:

                The calculated CH4 emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of forest areas.
                    The calculation considers the area of forest burnt, the specific emission
                    factor for fuel burning in forests, the combustion factor, and the
                    emission factor for CH4 emissions.
      :rtype: float


   .. py:method:: burning_n2o_forest()

      Calculates nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the burning of forests.
      This method assesses N2O emissions specifically from forest areas where vegetation
      and other biomass are burnt. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas, and its emissions
      can be significant in forest burning events.

      The calculation involves several factors: an emission factor for the fuel burning
      in forests, a emission factor (Gef) for N2O emissions from forest burning,
      and a combustion factor (Cf) that represents the efficiency of biomass combustion.

      The total N2O emissions are estimated by multiplying the area of forest burnt, the
      emission factor for fuel burning, the combustion factor, and the emission
      factor for N2O. The result is then converted into tonnes for easier reporting and
      comparison.

      :returns:

                The calculated N2O emissions (in tonnes) from the burning of forest areas.
                    The calculation considers the area of forest burnt, the specific emission
                    factor for fuel burning in forests, the combustion factor, and the
                    emission factor for N2O emissions.
