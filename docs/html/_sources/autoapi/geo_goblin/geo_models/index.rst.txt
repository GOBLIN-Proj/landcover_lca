.. py:class:: DynamicData(data, defaults={})


   DynamicData is a utility class designed for managing data with an emphasis on overriding default values with real data, if available.
   This class is typically used as a base class for other classes such as Land_Use_Category and LandUseCollections.

   Initialization:
       DynamicData(data, defaults={})

   :param data: A dictionary containing the real data. Each key-value pair in this dictionary represents a data attribute and its value.
   :type data: dict
   :param defaults: A dictionary of default values. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
                    Each key-value pair represents a default attribute and its value.
   :type defaults: dict, optional

   Description:
       Upon initialization, DynamicData first sets all attributes based on the 'defaults' dictionary.
       If the same attributes are present in the 'data' dictionary, the default values are overwritten with the values from 'data'.
       This ensures that all attributes have values, using defaults when real data is not available.

   Usage:
       The class is typically used as a superclass. Derived classes inherit the functionality of initializing and managing
       data with default and real values.

   .. rubric:: Example

   class Land_Use_Category(DynamicData):
       pass

   category_data = {"name": "Residential", "code": 100}
   default_values = {"name": "Unknown", "code": 0}

   category = Land_Use_Category(category_data, default_values)

   In this example, Land_Use_Category inherits from DynamicData. When an instance of Land_Use_Category is created,
   it contains the real data if available; otherwise, it falls back to the default values.


.. py:class:: Land_Use_Category(data, calibration_year)


   Bases: :py:obj:`DynamicData`

   Land_Use_Category is a subclass of DynamicData, specialized in handling data related to land use categories.
   It initializes with a set of default values for various land use attributes, and these defaults can be overridden with actual data.

   The class primarily deals with attributes like farm ID, year, land use type, area in hectares, and various shares related
   to land use such as mineral, organic, rewetted, burnt, and peat extraction.

   Initialization:
       Land_Use_Category(data, calibration_year)

   :param data: A dictionary containing the actual data for land use categories. Each key-value pair in this dictionary
                should correspond to a land use attribute and its value.
   :type data: dict
   :param calibration_year: The year used for calibration, which sets the default year value for land use.
   :type calibration_year: int

   Default Values:
       The class initializes the following default values:
       - farm_id: 0
       - year: The year provided in calibration_year
       - land_use: 'no'
       - area_ha: 0
       - share_mineral: 0
       - share_organic: 0
       - share_rewetted_in_organic: 0
       - share_burnt: 0
       - share_rewetted_in_mineral: 0
       - share_rewetted_in_mineral_organic: 0
       - share_peat_extraction: 0

   Usage:
       This class can be used to create instances representing different land use categories, with the flexibility to
       input actual data or rely on default settings.

   .. rubric:: Example

   land_use_data = {"farm_id": 123, "land_use": "agriculture"}
   category = Land_Use_Category(land_use_data, 2022)

   In this example, an instance of Land_Use_Category is created with specific data for a farm, and the default
   values are used for unspecified attributes.


.. py:class:: LandUseCollection(data)


   Bases: :py:obj:`DynamicData`

   LandUseCollection is a subclass of DynamicData, designed to handle collections of land use data. Unlike the Land_Use_Category class,
   this class does not utilize default values for its data attributes. It inherits the core functionality of DynamicData to manage
   its data attributes solely based on the input data provided.

   The primary use of this class, along with Land_Use_Category, is within the load_land_use_data() function, where it serves to organize
   and manage collections of land use data items.

   Initialization:
       LandUseCollection(data)

   :param data: A dictionary containing the land use data. Each key-value pair in this dictionary represents an attribute of the
   :type data: dict
   :param land use collection and its corresponding value.:

   Usage:
       This class is intended to aggregate and manage multiple instances or items of land use data. It is particularly useful in scenarios
       where a collection of land use data items needs to be processed or manipulated as a single entity.

   .. rubric:: Example

   land_use_items = [{"farm_id": 1, "land_use": "agriculture"}, {"farm_id": 2, "land_use": "forestry"}]
   land_use_collection = LandUseCollection(land_use_items)

   In this example, LandUseCollection is instantiated with a list of land use data dictionaries. Each item in the list represents
   a separate land use data point. The LandUseCollection instance manages these as a collective group of data items.


.. py:class:: TransitionData(data, defaults={})


   TransitionData is a class similar to DynamicData, but it specifically manages transition data.
   It initializes with default values and overrides them with actual data if available. The primary distinction
   lies in its handling of certain data types, specifically converting values to integers or floats as needed.

   This class is designed to be inherited by other classes, such as TransitionMatrixCategory, to provide a
   standardized way of handling transition data across different categories.

   Initialization:
       TransitionData(data, defaults={})

   :param data: A dictionary containing the actual transition data. Each key-value pair in this dictionary
                represents a transition attribute and its value.
   :type data: dict
   :param defaults: A dictionary of default values for transition data attributes. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
                    Each key-value pair represents a default transition attribute and its value.
   :type defaults: dict, optional

   Special Handling:
       - If the variable is "Year" or "farm_id", the value is converted to an integer.
       - For other variables, values are converted to integers after being interpreted as floats.

   Usage:
       This class is intended to be used for managing transition data, where default values are provided and can
       be overridden by actual data. It's particularly useful in scenarios requiring data type conversions for
       specific fields like "Year" and "farm_id".

   .. rubric:: Example

   transition_data = {"Year": "2022", "farm_id": "100", "area_ha": "250.5"}
   default_values = {"Year": 0, "farm_id": 0, "area_ha": 0}
   transition_instance = TransitionData(transition_data, default_values)

   In this example, a TransitionData instance is created with specific data, where numerical values are
   properly converted and defaults are used for unspecified attributes.


.. py:class:: TransitionMatrixCategory(data, ef_country, calibration_year)


   Bases: :py:obj:`TransitionData`

   TransitionMatrixCategory is a subclass of TransitionData, specifically tailored for managing transition matrix data related to different categories.
   It inherits the functionality of TransitionData, with the addition of category-specific default values.

   This class is primarily used for initializing transition data with a set of default values that are relevant to a particular category,
   such as country, farm_id, year, land use, and area in hectares. These defaults can be overridden with actual data.

   Initialization:
       TransitionMatrixCategory(data, ef_country, calibration_year)

   :param data: A dictionary containing the actual data for the transition matrix category.
                Each key-value pair in this dictionary represents an attribute of the category and its value.
   :type data: dict
   :param ef_country: A string representing the default value for the country attribute in the transition matrix category.
   :type ef_country: str
   :param calibration_year: An integer representing the default value for the Year attribute in the transition matrix category.
   :type calibration_year: int

   Default Values:
       The class initializes the following default values:
       - country: The value provided in ef_country
       - farm_id: 0
       - Year: The year provided in calibration_year
       - land_use: 'no'
       - area_ha: 0

   Usage:
       This class is used to manage transition matrix data for different categories, allowing for the easy setup of default values
       and the ability to override them with actual data. It is useful in scenarios where data consistency and type conversion
       are important for transition matrices.

   .. rubric:: Example

   transition_category_data = {"farm_id": 123, "land_use": "agriculture", "area_ha": "250.5"}
   category = TransitionMatrixCategory(transition_category_data, "ireland", 2022)

   In this example, a TransitionMatrixCategory instance is created with specific data for a farm in the ireland for the year 2022.
   The default values are used for unspecified attributes while ensuring the proper data type conversions.
